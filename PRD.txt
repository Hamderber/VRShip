redesign to support multi-size blocks
procedural asteroid generation
resource gathering
increase ship buildable size with some type of upgrade
make space skybox
simple ship save/load
make base class that all ship parts will inherit
blocks placed contribute to overall ship mass but have their own health
make picked up blocks not inherit hand's rotation
find a way to prevent placing blocks floating in the air, they must be adjacent to something else
if a block becomes floating, it is destroyed (maybe breaks off somehow? might be expensive to calculate)
**orbital mechanics eventually
build mode and play mode
trading stations
radiant quests?
change building from tracking ship core's vector3's to gameobject (still use vector3 for placement checking)
any weapon on grid verifies there are no blocks in front of it before firing
projectiles fired inherit the reference to what shot it and doesnt do damage to that thing
establish list of blocks that are heavily recommended to make a ship "valid"
inventory size is infinite but slightly increases energy usage and ship mass

when ship health is 0, it explodes
if player doesnt eject in escape pod they lose all gained experience and fail all quests (which are radiant, maybe remove in the future)
if player does eject, they keep everything and respawn at a random (or maybe selected?) trading station

ship block types: ** = required
 - ** pressurized water reactor or quantum cheat cube or batteries (power source)
 - ** thrusters (add directional velocity and automattically assist in stopping ship with no directional input)
 - ** inventory matrix (only one allowed, gives ship an inventory)
 - multi-dimensional all-in-one super cube (only one allowed, removes the requirement of ALL mandatory blocks with a penalty of them being only 10% effective, but inventory still infinite)
 - turrets
 - ** gyroscope (use a function of mass and number of gyroscopes to improve how easy the ship is to control, no rotation if no gyros)
 - pressurized magnesuim flares (tracking-targets or raytraces that intersect within a range of flare make the flare become target)
 - armor blocks
 - ** cockpit (only one allowed, required even if super cube is added)
 - shield generator (self-explanatory, if shield generator active damaged blocks have a shield shader when damaged and the shield health is reduced instead)
 - solar sail (very, very, very small one-directional thrust given but they produce power!)
 - ** life support system (if destroyed, calcualtion of blocks on ship and time to determine when player will die if they dont eject before time runs out)
 - radar (shows players where nearby things are on screen)
